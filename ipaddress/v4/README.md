# IP Address V4 core modules

Author: 0xb4db01

These are the core modules for the IP Address V4 module, don't import these modules directly, use ipaddress_v4.nim in the previous directory.
Importing ipaddress_v4 will provide you all the objects, methods and overloads for IPAddressV4, IPNetworkV4 and IANA utils. This is how it's ment to be used.
